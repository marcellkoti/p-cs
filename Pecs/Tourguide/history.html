      <ol><tr><td>2.The city of <em>Sopianae</em> was founded by Romans at the beginning of the 2nd century, in an area peopled by Celts and Pannoni tribes.
      
      When Western Hungary was a province of the Roman Empire (named Pannonia), the Romans founded several wine-producing colonies under the collective name of Sopianae where PÃ©cs now stands, in the early 2nd century.</td></tr>
      </ol>
      <ol><tr><td>3.The centre of Sopianae was where the Bishop's Palace now stands. Some parts of the Roman aqueduct are still visible. When Pannonia province was divided into four administrative divisions, Sopianae was the capital of the division named Valeria.
      
      By the 4th century, Sopianae became the capital of Valeria province and a significant early Christian center. The early Christian necropolis in the city dates back to this age, and the Christian tombs there are unique in their architectural design (with underground burial chambers below above-ground memorial chapels) and are highly decorated with Christian murals. These tombs became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in December 2000. By the end of the century, Roman rule weakened in the area, mostly due to attacks by Barbarians and Huns.</td></tr>
